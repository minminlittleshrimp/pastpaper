QUESTION Condition 9618_w21_qp_31, 32
Numbers are stored in a computer using floating-point representation with:
- 12 bits for the mantissa
- 4 bits for the exponent
- twoâ€™s complement form for both the mantissa and exponent.

QUESTION Normalised floating point
Write the normalised floating-point representation of the following unsigned binary number using this system.
\
1011100.011001
Ans: Mantissa Exponent
- Mantissa: %"010111000110"
- Exponent: %"0111"
\
QUESTION Consequence & Justification
State the consequence of storing the binary number in above part as a floating-point number in this system. Justify your answer.
- The %"precision" of the number would be %"reduced"
- The original number had %"13" bits / %"14" bits with sign but the mantissa can only store %"12" bits
\
QUESTION Explanation
Explain the reason why binary numbers are stored in normalised form:
- To store the %"maximum range" of numbers in the %"minimum number" of bytes
- Normalisation %"minimises" the number of "leading" zeros/ones represented
- Avoids the possibility of many numbers having %"multiple" representations
