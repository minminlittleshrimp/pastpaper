QUESTION Condition 9618_s23_qp_31
Numbers are stored in two different computer systems by using floating-point representation.
System 1 uses:
- 10 bits for the mantissa
- 6 bits for the exponent
- two’s complement form for both the mantissa and the exponent.
System 2 uses:
- 8 bits for the mantissa
- 8 bits for the exponent
- two’s complement form for both the mantissa and the exponent

QUESTION Floating point
Calculate the normalised floating-point representation of 113.75 and show how it would be represented in each of these two systems. Show your working.
\
Ans:
\
System 1:
- Mantissa: %"0111000111"
- Exponent: %"000111"
\
System 2:
- Mantissa: %"01110001"
- Exponent: %"00000111"
\
QUESTION Explanation
Explain the problem that occurred in above part when representing the number in system 2.
- The %"mantissa" in system 2 does not have enough %"bits" to store the whole binary number (%"10" bits required and only %"8" bits available)
- %"Precision" is lost and the number is %"truncated"
