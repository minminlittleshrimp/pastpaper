QUESTION Condition 9618_w22_qp_31, 33
Real numbers are stored in a computer system using floating-point representation with:
- 8 bits for the mantissa
- 8 bits for the exponent
- Two’s complement form for both the mantissa and the exponent.

QUESTION Floating point
Write the normalised floating-point representation of +202 in this system.
Show your working.
\
Ans: Mantissa Exponent
- Mantissa: %"01100101"
- Exponent: %"00001000"
\
QUESTION Normalisation
Write the normalised floating-point representation of –202 in this system. Show your working.
\
Ans: Normalised Data
- Mantissa: %"10011011"
- Exponent: %"00001000"
\
QUESTION Explanation
A binary number is stored in the computer system
- Mantissa: "00011110"
- Exponent: "00011000"
State why the number is not normalised.
- The mantissa does not begin with %"01"/%"10" (as its %"most" significant bits)
\
Write the normalised floating-point representation of the number.
\
Ans: Normalised Data
- Mantissa: %"01111000"
- Exponent: %"00010110"
