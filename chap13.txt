Real numbers are stored in a computer system using floating-point representation with:
- 10 bits for the mantissa
- 6 bits for the exponent
- Two’s complement form for both the mantissa and the exponent.
a. Calculate the normalised floating-point representation of –7.25 in this system.
Show your working.
\
Ans: Mantissa Exponent
- Mantissa: %"1000110000"
- Exponent: %"000011"
\
b. Calculate the denary value of the given binary floating-point number. Show your working.
- Mantissa: "1000110000"
- Exponent: "000011"
\
Ans: Denary
- %"-78.25"
\
c. The given binary floating-point number is not normalised. Normalise the floating-point number. Show your working.
- Mantissa: "0000000111"
- Exponent: "100111"
\
Ans: Normalised Data
- Mantissa: %"0111000000"
- Exponent: %"100001"
\
d. The denary number 513 cannot be stored accurately as a normalised floating-point number in this computer system.
\
i. Explain the reason for this:
- Requires %"11" bits to store accurately maximum %"positive" number that can be stored (%"511")
- Denary 513 in binary is %"1000000001" and it is normalised: %"0.1000000001" result in %"overflow"
